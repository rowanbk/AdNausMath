Example 1.

python3 calcAN.py deck.txt -f 0 -r 3 -d 1 -l 20 -p "Island Ponder Swamp Duress Underground Sea Dark Ritual Lotus Petal Infernal Tutor Lions Eye Diamond"

python3 (my python version)
calcAN.py (program name)
deck.txt (contains decklist)
-f 0  (nothing floating)
-r 3  (3 lands in play, relevant for Rain of Filth)
-d 1  (already played my land for the turn)
-l 20 (20 life remaining)
-p "Island Ponder Swamp Duress Underground Sea Dark Ritual Lotus Petal Infernal Tutor Lions Eye Diamond"
	what I've played so far this game, these cards are removed from the deck for the simulation
-c ""
	no -c option is specifed, since I cast the Ad Nause off LED no cards are left in my hand


Example 2.

python3 calcAN.py deck.txt -f 2 -r 1 -d 1 -l 20 -p "Underground Sea Dark Ritual Dark Ritual Dark Ritual" -c "Lions Eye Diamond"
